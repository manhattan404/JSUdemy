// BASIC BOOLEAN LOGIC : and, or, not (operators)

/*

and : both conditions have to be true
or: only one condition has to be true
not: inverst true/false value

*/

/*

Boolean variables that can either be true or false.

A. Sarah has a driver's license
B. Sarah has a good vision

*/

// Let's do an example

const age = 16;

/*

Boolean Variables
A. Age is greater or equal 20 - FALSE
B. Age is less than 30 - TRUE

*/

/* Let's use operators

!A (false) - TRUE because it the 'not operator' inverts it

A(false) AND B(true) = FALSE because both variables have to be true.

A(false) OR B(true) = TRUE because only one variable is enough to be true.

!A(true) AND B9true) = TRUE because both variable are true.

A(false) OR !B(false) = FALSE because neither of both variable are true.
