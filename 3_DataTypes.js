// 7 Primitive Data Types 

// Number : Floating point numbers. Used for decimals and integers 
let age = 23;

// String : Sequence of characters. Used for text 
let firstName = 'Jonas';

// Boolean : logical type that can only be true or false. Used for taking decisions
let fullAge = true;

// Undefined : value taken by a variable that is not yet defined. Empty value.
let children;

// Null : also mean empty value

// Symbol : Value that is unique and cannot be changed 

// BigInt : larger integers than the Number type can hold. 

// JS has dynamic typing, which means you don't have to manually define a data type unlike other programming languages.

// Variables can be changed from a number to a string. 

// You can comment out codes that you don't want to execute. 
// Press "Control + /" to comment out lines of codes. 
// you can also use /* */ = this is a multi line comment

let javascriptIsFun = true;
console.log(javascriptIsFun);
// this will log 'true' in the console

console.log(typeof true); // this will log 'boolean'. typeof is an operator.
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun); // this will log 'boolean' because it is assigned to a boolean value 
console.log(typeof 23); // this will log 'number'
console.log(typeof "Jonas"); // this will log 'string'
